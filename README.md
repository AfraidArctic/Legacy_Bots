# Legacy_Bots
Bots made with discord.py when I started to make the Discord RPGMaker project. Don't expect much of it to work. I made this repository mainly to see how far I've come.

My code was very amateurish at the time, so don't expect much. Also, this was made before discord introduced slash commands.
